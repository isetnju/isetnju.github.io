1. ABOUT

PubList is a custom export for JabRef
(http://jabref.sourceforge.net/), which can be used to create HTML
code for a list of publications (bibliography list).  The generated
HTML code does not contain a header nor a body.  Its purpose is to be
included in other HTML files or in text-to-html source files
(e.g. Jemdoc).


2. INSTALLATION

Requirement: this software requires JabRef, which can be found at
http://jabref.sourceforge.net

To install this export in JabRef, follow the steps below (you
should also consult the help document of JabRef):
- Extract and copy all files in the PubList distribution to a
  directory.
- Open JabRef and select menu Options/Manage Custom Exports
- In the opened dialog box, click "Add new" to create a new export.
  Enter "PubList" as the export name and "html" as the file
  extension.  Click "Browse" and select file "publist.layout" in the
  PubList directory as the main layout file.
- Click "OK" then "Close" to complete.  When you select menu
  File/Export, PubList should be now in the list of available
  exports.


3. USAGE

PubList exports a list of bibliography items from JabRef to raw HTML
code.  The generated HTML file cannot be dislayed directly but needs
to be embedded in other HTML files.  If your HTML files are generated
by a text-to-html tool, such as Jemdoc or org-mode, you can include
the HTML publication list file in your source file as raw HTML code.
Currently, support for Jemdoc is included in the PubList
distribution.

3.1. Export a publication list from JabRef

- Open JabRef then select menu File/Export to export all items in your
  library.  If you want to export selected items instead, highlight
  them in the main window and select menu File/Export selected
  entries.
- In the export dialog, select "PubList" as the file format, specify a
  file name then click "Save."  A new file should be created
  containing the HTML code for the publication list.


3.2. Embed a PubList file in Jemdoc

All files necessary for embedding PubList files in Jemdoc are located
in the sub-directory "Jemdoc" in the PubList distribution.  First,
copy bibtex.conf to somewhere jemdoc can find (it will be used as a
configuration file for jemdoc).  Then copy bibtex.css to the CSS
folder of your output HTML files.

To produce the list in an HTML file named "bib.html" generated by
PubList, create a new jemdoc document (or edit an existing one) and
add the command:
  #includeraw{bib.html}
at the place where the list should appear.  In the header of the
jemdoc file, add the CSS file bibtex.css as following:
  # jemdoc: addcss{bibtex.css}
Jemdoc must be called with the configuration file bibtex.conf, as
follows:
  jemdoc.py -c bibtex.conf -o <output folder> <jemdoc file>

Note that file bibtex.css must be in a directory where the output HTML
file can find.


3.3. Custom CSS

The appearance of the publication list can be customized using the
following CSS classes:
div.bibtex - the sliding box containing the BibTeX code.
biblist - the ordered list of publication items.
bibitem - the list item of one publication.

Refer to file bibtex.css for details.


3.4. Include links to files

In many cases, links to files need to be included after each
publication, for example the PDF file of the paper, a ZIP file
containing computer code, etc.  These links can be created
automatically using a custom field named "pllinks" in the BibTeX
code of a publication.  The format of this field is the same as that
of the field "file" used by JabRef.  Refer to JabRef's help document
for more information.

NOTE: in older versions of PubList, the field "filelinks" was used
instead of "pllinks".  It was renamed for consistency (prefix "pl"
stands for PubList).


3.5. Custom style for a publication item

Each publication item is exported to an HTML list item ("li" tag).  By
default, a plain list item style is used (<li>...</li>).  However, if
a BibTeX item contains a field named "plstyle", the content of this
field will be appended to the "li" tag, allowing customizations by the
user.  For example, you can define a CSS class named "reditem" to set
the font color to red:
  .biblist li.reditem {color:red;}
and include a field "plstyle" in a BibTeX item:
  plstyle = {class="reditem"}
then the exported HTML code of the item will be:
  <li class="reditem">...</li>
